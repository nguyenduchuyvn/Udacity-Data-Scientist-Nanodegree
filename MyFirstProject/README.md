# Happiness around the world 

## Project Motivation
I'm curious about the happiness of people around the world, that's why I discovered the awesome dataset on Kaggle. In this project, I try to find the answers to the following questions:
- Which country/region are the top happiest or the least happy countries?
- How did the happiness score and other factors change from 2015 to 2021?
- Which factors are the most influential for happiness score?
- What is the relationship between other factors (Economy, Healthy, Social support, Freedom, Generosity, Corruption Perception)?
