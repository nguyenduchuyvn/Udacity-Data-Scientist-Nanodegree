# Udacity-Data-Scientist-Nanodegree

This repository contains my projects for Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree.

## Project 1: Write a Data Science Blog Post

For this project, I apply the CRISP-DM process on the world happiness data from 2015 to 2021. This dataset could be founded in the Kaggle Dataset [World Happiness Report 2015-2021](https://www.kaggle.com/mathurinache/world-happiness-report-20152021). It is my opportunity to explore the happiness data of countries and communicate the insight via medium blog.

## Project 2: Disaster Response Pipelines
In this project, I try to analyze disaster data to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages. I've created a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events. The detail can be found in here. Finally, this project also has a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories.

## Project 3: Recommendations with IBM

In this project I try to analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles. 
Firstly, I explore the data for the project. Then, I build several recommendations system such as: Rank Based Recommendations, User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
