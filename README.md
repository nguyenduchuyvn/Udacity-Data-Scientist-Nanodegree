# Udacity-Data-Scientist-Nanodegree

This repository contains my projects for Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree.

## Project 1: Write a Data Science Blog Post

For this project, I apply the CRISP-DM process on the world happiness data from 2015 to 2021. This dataset could be founded in the Kaggle Dataset [World Happiness Report 2015-2021](https://www.kaggle.com/mathurinache/world-happiness-report-20152021). It is my opportunity to explore the happiness data of countries and communicate the insight via medium blog.
